I received my B.Sc degree in Physiscs from [University of Valencia](https://www.uv.es/uvweb/college/en/university-valencia-1285845048380.html), Spain, in 2016 and my M.Sc. degree in Mechatronics from [Polytechnic University of Valencia](https://www.upv.es/en), Spain, in 2018.

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree at [University of Agder](https://www.uia.no/en), Norway.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
