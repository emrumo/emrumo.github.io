  abstract={Kernel-based approaches have achieved noticeable success as non-parametric regression methods under the framework of stochastic optimization. However, most of the kernel-based methods in the literature are not suitable to track sequentially streamed quantized data samples from dynamic environments. This shortcoming occurs mainly for two reasons: first, their poor versatility in tracking variables that may change unpredictably over time, primarily because of their lack of flexibility when choosing a functional cost that best suits the associated regression problem; second, their indifference to the smoothness of the underlying physical signal generating those samples. This work introduces a novel algorithm constituted by an online regression problem that accounts for these two drawbacks and a stochastic proximal method that exploits its structure. In addition, we provide tracking guarantees by analyzing the dynamic regret of our algorithm. Finally, we present some experimental results that support our theoretical analysis and show that our algorithm has a favorable performance compared to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract={The question of how to produce a smooth interpolating curve from a stream of data points is addressed in this paper. To this end, we formalize the concept of real-time interpolator (RTI): a trainable unit that recovers smooth signals that are consistent with the received input samples in an online manner. Specifically, an RTI works under the requirement of producing a function section immediately after a sample is received (zero delay), without changing the reconstructed signal in past time sections. This work formulates the design of spline-based RTIs as a bi-level optimization problem. Their training consists in minimizing the average curvature of the interpolated signals over a set of example sequences. The latter are representative of the nature of the data sequence to be interpolated, allowing to tailor the RTI to a specific signal source. Our overall design allows for different possible schemes. In this work, we present two approaches, namely, the parametrized RTI and the recurrent neural network (RNN)-based RTI, including their architecture and properties. Experimental results show that the two proposed RTIs can be trained in a data-driven fashion to achieve improved performance (in terms of the curvature loss metric) with respect to a myopic-type RTI that only exploits the local information at each time sample, while maintaining smooth, zero-delay, and consistency requirements.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
